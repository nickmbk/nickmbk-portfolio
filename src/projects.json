    "description": "This was a team project where I contributed mostly to the implementation of the design given to me.  I made the design come to life, customising Bootstrap elements to give them our own colour scheme and look.  The Travel List uses Google Maps API and Unsplash API to give users an interactive list that can help them choose where to go on holiday.  Their favourite places can be stored in a list so they can easily access them again later.  The user is shown some images and a map of the destination they have entered.  If they do not know where they want to travel they can click the Random button to randomly choose a destination."
