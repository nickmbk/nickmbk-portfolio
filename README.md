  ## Description

  This is my personal portfolio that showcases the projects I have done on the bootcamp and will be looked at by potential employers.  All my contact information is on there for employers to contact me.

  This project was built using React, combined with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This was my first time building a project using React.  I faced a fair few problems along the way but after a lot of Googling I always found a solution.

  The biggest problem I faced, trying to pass props from one class to another class via React Router.  When a user clicks on a project in the Project Gallery, I wanted a new component to populate the page with the props it had been passed.  But I found that it was hard to pass props to a class, particularly if itâ€™s via React Router.  I had to change the component that was receiving the props to a function rather than it being a class.  This allowed the component to receive the information via the useLocation() hook.
  
  Another Issue I had, which took a long time to find the answer, getting images to display when the path for the image was being extracted from a JSON file.  I eventually found out it was mostly to do with where the images were stored, they needed to be stored with the index.html file in the public folder.

  I have learnt a lot about React during this project, but have also learnt I still have so much to learn about it.  

  In the future I would like to add some features to make my portfolio a bit more interesting, such as some animations and maybe a few images.
